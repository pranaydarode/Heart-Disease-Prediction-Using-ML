Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression:-

This repository contains code and resources for predicting heart disease using a Logistic Regression model. The model was trained on a dataset containing physical attributes of patients, including features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

Dataset: -
The dataset used for this project is available in the file (https://github.com/pranaydarode/Diabetes-Prediction-Model/blob/main/heart_disease_data.csv). It includes 14 physical attributes based on physical testing of patients. Blood samples were taken, and patients also underwent a brief exercise test. The target variable, labeled as “presence,” indicates whether a patient has heart disease (1 for presence, 0 for no presence).

Model Training: -
We implemented a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on the provided features. Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a binary outcome (in our case, presence or absence of heart disease).

Usage: -
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn).
Explore the Jupyter Notebook file Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb to understand the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Results: -
Our trained model achieved promising results in predicting heart disease presence. By accurately identifying patients at risk, we can help avoid expensive and invasive procedures.

Acknowledgments: -
We thank the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospitals in Zurich and Basel, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for providing the original dataset1. I used only standard Python libraries for this project.
